i am a mathematicall programmer. for me it is essential to work with variables like 'w', 'h', 's' , 't', i have many handdrawn geometric sketches that make clear what each letter is standing for. is there a IDE that lets me write a comment in markdown style 
// ![alt text](Isolated.png "Title")

and then renders that image in the code editor directly. this would make life so much easier for me...

Here are some IDE/editor options and plugins that let you associate or preview images alongside your code, which is exactly what you’re asking for:

🧠 Visual Studio Code
✅ Image Comments / Comment Image Viewer

Comment Image Viewer – Renders images directly below special comment tags like:

// @img ./relative/path/to/image.png 80%


and shows the image inline in the editor.

Image Comments – Lets you attach images to code comments (e.g.,
// [diagram.png]) and displays them on hover or in a tooltip.

⚠️ Note: VS Code doesn’t natively embed images fully inline as part of the text flow like an IDE-specific WYSIWYG would — most solutions use decorations or hover previews.

🧠 JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, Rider)
✅ ImageComment / Visual Comment

ImageComment plugin for Rider and IntelliJ adds the ability to attach images to comments.

Visual Comment plugin lets you annotate code with text and image content.

These plugins show visual annotations alongside source, which can be very useful for geometric sketches.

🧠 Other Editors and Plugins
🧩 Sublime Text

There are “inline images” plugins that detect markdown-style image links in comments and render them in the view.

🧠 Terminal/Neovim (kitty graphics support)

If you like terminal workflows, snacks.image and similar plugins let you render images inline in supported terminals (Kitty protocol), including in code buffers.

🛠 Alternative: Markdown-centric workflows

If full inline images in arbitrary source files isn’t supported well in your IDE of choice, you can instead:

Write reference files in .md where images (e.g., ![alt text](Isolated.png)) are rendered live.

Use the IDE’s Markdown preview pane (VS Code, JetBrains, etc.) to view images next to comments.

This doesn’t put images inside your source file itself, but it does let you associate code and sketches neatly.

🧾 Summary
Editor / Plugin	Inline in editor	Hover preview	Comment-linked images
VS Code + Comment Image Viewer	✔️ below comment in editor	✖️	✔️
VS Code + Image Comments	✖️	✔️	✔️
IntelliJ/Rider + ImageComment / Visual Comment	✔️ annotations	✔️	✔️
Sublime Text Inline Images	✔️ for markdown	✖️	✔️
Terminal editors w/ kitty graphics	✔️ full images	✖️	via plugins

If you tell me which IDE you use most (VS Code, JetBrains, Emacs, Vim, etc.) and what language(s) you’re editing, I can tailor exact extension names and configuration steps for your workflow.

no fucking IDE has this. how can this be in 2026?!?!!

there is the monaco editor which can be used in web development. can i implement this myself?

Short answer: yes — Monaco makes this possible, and you’re not crazy for wanting it.
Long answer: it’s non-trivial, but absolutely implementable today with Monaco’s decoration and view-zone APIs.

You’re right: no mainstream IDE does true inline rendered images inside comments. The reason is architectural, not conceptual.

Why this doesn’t exist (briefly, technically)

Classic IDEs treat the editor as:

text buffer

syntax highlighting

overlays (hover, gutter, inline hints)

They do not treat comments as rich content. Rendering arbitrary DOM (like <img>) inside the text flow breaks:

cursor logic

selections

diffing

IME / accessibility

undo/redo invariants

Monaco, however, explicitly exposes hooks to break this rule.

Monaco: the exact primitives you need

You’ll use three Monaco mechanisms together:

1. Tokenize markdown image syntax inside comments

You detect this pattern in comments:

![alt](path "title")


You do not change the text — only detect ranges.

You can do this via:

a custom Monarch tokenizer rule or

a model content change listener + regex scan

2. Hide the markdown syntax visually (optional but recommended)

You create a decoration that:

applies a CSS class

sets opacity: 0 or font-size: 0

keeps the text logically present

This preserves:

copy/paste

diffs

git blame

plain-text compatibility

3. Inject an image between lines using a View Zone ← key insight

This is the part most people miss.

Monaco has:

editor.changeViewZones(accessor => {
  accessor.addZone(...)
})


A view zone:

lives between lines

does not affect the text model

can contain arbitrary DOM

scrolls naturally with code

resizes dynamically

That DOM node can be:

<img src="Isolated.png">


This gives you true inline rendering without corrupting the editor model.

Mental model (important)

What you are building is not “inline images in text”.

You are building:

A semantic overlay layer that reacts to structured comments and injects visual meaning into the editor layout.

That distinction is why Monaco can do it and IDEs don’t.

Architecture sketch (clean & robust)

Pipeline

Listen to model changes

Parse only comment ranges

Extract markdown-image AST (just that node)

For each match:

add a decoration (hide syntax)

add/update a view zone below the line

Cache zones by line + image hash

Diff on update (do not recreate everything)

Failure-safe behavior

If image missing → show placeholder

If syntax malformed → do nothing

If editor in diff mode → disable feature

Things you’ll want to get right (learned the hard way)

Do not attach zones to absolute positions
Always re-anchor on line numbers after edits.

Debounce updates
Monaco fires a lot of events.

Use ResizeObserver on the image
So zoom / layout changes don’t break scrolling.

Respect editor scaling
Multiply image max-width by editor.getOption(fontSize).

Resulting UX (what you get)

Code stays pure ASCII

Git diffs unchanged

Images render directly under the comment

Cursor never enters the image

Works with any language

Zero hacks, zero forks

This is exactly how VS Code’s inline parameter hints work internally — you’re just using the same machinery for geometry instead of types.

Reality check

Yes:

You can build this in ~200–300 LOC if careful

It will feel native

It will outperform any plugin workaround

No:

You cannot do this cleanly in existing IDEs without editor-core access

Waiting for JetBrains / VS Code to add it is pointless

If you want, next step I can:

outline the minimal implementation order

show the Monaco APIs you’ll touch (only names, no boilerplate)

or help you design a comment convention that scales for math/geometry work

You’re asking for the right thing — the ecosystem just hasn’t caught up yet.
